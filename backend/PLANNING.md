Scheduler Implementation
We'll implement a background task system using NestJS's built-in scheduling capabilities:

A cron job will run every minute to check for posts that need to be published
When a post's scheduled time arrives, the scheduler will:

Load the post data from MongoDB
Read the image from the file system
Call the Instagram API to publish the post
Update the post status to 'posted' or 'failed'
Record the posting timestamp



Instagram API Integration
use official API from Meta for GraphApi

Handle authentication with Instagram
Upload photos
Add captions
Post content to feed

Error Handling

Failed posts will be marked as 'failed' with an error message
The system will include logging for debugging issues
API will return appropriate error responses with status codes
